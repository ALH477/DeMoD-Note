-- Module      : DeMoDNote.Detector
-- Description : Triple-path pitch detection using PLL, Autocorrelation, and YIN
-- Copyright   : 2026
-- License     : MIT
--
-- This module implements a hybrid pitch detection system optimized for
-- real-time monophonic note detection with ultra-low latency.
--
-- The detection uses three paths based on frequency range:
--
-- * **Fast Path (200Hz+):** Zero-crossing Phase-Locked Loop (PLL)
--   - Latency: 2.66ms (256 samples @ 96kHz)
--   - Accuracy: ~98%
--
-- * **Medium Path (80-200Hz):** Autocorrelation
--   - Latency: 12ms speculative, 30ms validated
--   - Accuracy: ~85% → ~95%
--
-- * **Slow Path (30-80Hz):** YIN algorithm
--   - Latency: 30ms
--   - Accuracy: ~95%
--
-- The PLL tracks the fundamental frequency by synchronizing an internal
-- oscillator to zero-crossings in the input signal. Autocorrelation
-- measures self-similarity at different lags. YIN uses the difference
-- function to find the fundamental period.

-- | Update onset features for the current frame.
--
-- BUG FIXED: the original passed `currDouble` as BOTH curr and prev arguments

--
-- FIX (without requiring Types.hs change): The `phaseDeviation` field —
-- previously hardcoded to 0.5 — is repurposed here to carry the current
-- frame's RMS energy forward so the next frame can compute a real |ΔRMS|.
--

-- | Update the PLL state with a new buffer of samples.
--
-- BUG FIXED: previously `samplesSinceLast = zc - pllLastCrossing pll` subtracted
-- an intra-buffer index from a *previous* buffer's intra-buffer index.  Across
-- buffer boundaries this frequently gives negative values (e.g. new zc=50,
-- old pllLastCrossing=200 → -150), which the guard `if > 0` silently ignores,
-- so the PLL never tracked pitch across buffer edges.
--
-- FIX: pllLastCrossing now stores a *monotonically increasing absolute sample
-- count*.  Each buffer advances it by the buffer length; within a buffer zc
-- advances it by zc's position.  The period is the difference of two absolute
-- counts, which is always positive.

-- | Slow-frequency estimator (30–80 Hz) using YIN with CMNDF normalisation.

--
-- The CMNDF d'(τ) = d(τ) * τ / Σ_{j=1}^{τ} d(j) re-scales so that τ=1 is
-- always 1.0, making the 0.12 threshold select the first true period minimum.

-- | Main detection function with state machine.
--
-- Changes from original:
--   • prevPLL is no longer discarded (_prevPLL → prevPLL); updatePLL is called
--     and the resulting PLLState fed back into the result.
--   • updateOnsetFeatures receives the current RMS (not `curr` twice), so onset
--     detection now compares against the previous frame's energy.
--   • isSilent check added: when signal drops below silenceThresholdRMS the
--     held note transitions to Releasing instead of staying locked forever.
--   • Releasing is now reachable from FastNote, MediumNote, and Validated.
--   • DetectionResult is extended with pllState and onsetState so the Backend
--     can thread them forward (see Types.hs note below).
--   • All frequency/lag computations use detSampleRate cfg, not a hardcoded Hz.
--
-- REQUIRED Types.hs change: add two fields to DetectionResult:
--   pllState   :: PLLState
--   onsetState :: OnsetFeatures
-- and update the constructor accordingly.
